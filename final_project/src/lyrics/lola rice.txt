Walked in to find you on the living room floor
The place is a mess and you’re the eye of the storm
Sit out on the steps for coffee and a cigarette
Take a picture in my head 
You complain about carrying her trauma
But I think that you like it 'cause it makes you feel stronger
Am I to blame if I don’t want you to fix me
The way you crave
So you’ll never even notice me
No I’m no burning house
Never even notice 'cause
It’s quiet when a pеrson drowns 
It’s quiеt when a person drowns
Underwater, sinking slow
When I hit bottom my mind let go 
Close my eyes and I let the darkness in
When I stopped fighting I learned to swim
I look at you and see myself behind the curtain
I look at you and I see someone who is searching
I saw you dancing in your room
I want to feel the music too
I want you but you don’t look at me
Clear blue water is all you ever see
You might also like
I’ve heard of falling, falling in love
But no one told me you gotta climb back up
Close my eyes and I better not look down
It's a wonder I survived and if I go back I will drown
I look at you and see myself behind the curtain
I look at you and I see someone who is searching
I saw you dancing in your room
I want to hear the music too
I want you but you don’t look at me
Clear blue water is all you ever see
And it's all you see
So you’ll never even notice me
No I’m no burning house
Never even notice 'cause
It’s quiet when a person drowns 
It’s quiet when a person drowns 
It’s quiet when a person drownsEmbed

They couldn’t hear him breathing
Ruled it a heart attack
Red circle on the concrete
And it all came down to that
Dropped dead on Eighty Fourth street
Just like Hatty’s dad
Now Hatty’s selling white sheets
And he never calls me back
And in the dead of night
The train tracks in the pale moonlight
You can’t get off that ride
When in the summertime
The walls inside are painted white
So you freeze up inside
Footsteps down the hallway
You haven’t got a clue
Where do you think you’re going
You’re so young for 22
That circle on the concrete
Is growing every day
They caught Hatty three times
Now he’ll never get away
You might also like
And in the dead of night
The angels in the pale moonlight
You can’t get off that ride
When in the summertime
The walls inside are painted white
So you freeze up inside
Did you give up inside?
Did you give up inside?Embed

You’re coming back from New York City
Been a year since you’ve been gone
Picked my​ outfit out already
I’ll put my favorite lipstick on
So when you tell me about all the bands you’ve seen
I’ll smile like a debutante and show my crooked teeth
You’re coming back from New York City
Been a long and lonely year
Practice talking, talking to myself into the mirror
And if I told you about all the boys I’ve seen
You’re coming home from New York
And we both know what that means
I need a way to get away
My charley horse won’t win this race
You push me back into the farthest corner of my brain
Why did you come back babe?
Why did you come back babe?
Why did you come back babe
I’ve got an alien inside me
Oh it’s growing day by day
I tried to hide it, tried to fight but it won’t go away
And if I told you of this alien disease
You’re coming home from New York
And we both know what that means
You might also like
I need a way to get away
My charley horse won’t win this race
You push me back into the farthest corner of my brain
Why did you come back babe?
Why did you come back babe?
Why did you come back babe
You push me back into the farthest corner of my brain
Why did you come back babe?
Why did you come back babe?
Why did you come back babe
Why did you come back babe?
Why did you come back babe?
Why did you come back babeEmbed

From the bottom of the barrel
I look up at the sun
Tell my younger self I’m sorry
For the things I haven’t done
I always run from the unknown
It follows me to oblivion
When you said that I’m not special
You probably were right
And when I find my pride is injured
Why can’t I just let it die?
There always was a question
That follows us into oblivion
Are we doomed to hate what we love 
Are we human if we try 
It’s not enough to be alive or just survive
We’re always sure there’s so much more
And for such a thing of beauty
We’re so cruelly designed
You don’t blame the house that’s haunted
So don’t blame the human mind
It always does some damage
That follows us, oblivious
You might also like
Are we doomed to hate what we love 
Are we human if we try 
It’s not enough to be alive or just survive
We’re always sure there’s so much more
Well I’ve tried to be brave
And I've tried to be strong
And I've tried to be wise
And I’ve tried to be young
I’ve tried to be brave
And I've tried to be strong
And I've tried to be wise
And I’ve tried to be young
Human, human
I’m humanEmbed
